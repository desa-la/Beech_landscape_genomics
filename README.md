## Beech_landscape_genomics

This repository includes scripts from Lazic et al., (2024): Genomic variation of European beech reveals signals of local adaptation despite high levels of phenotypic plasticity.
Data analysis is divided into folders:
1. Variant calling and filtering
2. Population genetics
3. Genotype-environment association
4. Genomic offset
